## Description
Short talk on literate programming with hands-on exercises using RStudio, RMarkdown, and GitHub.

## Prerequisites
During the talk, the audience will have access to my RStudio Server so only a web browser will be required. For anyone not attending who wants to try the examples, a free account on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) will work or a local installation of RStudio, with LaTeX and git enabled. The following R packages are used:
* ggplot2
* readxl
* haven
* dplyr
* tidyr
* knitr
* kableExtra
